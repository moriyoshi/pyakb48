pyakb48 documentation
=====================

Introduction
------------
This package is a port of a great Perl module called `Acme::AKB48`_ which was created by Hideo Kimura.  Although I don't have the slightest interest in AKB48_,  I happened to be under the impression that Python world (almost) totally lacks "Acme" essence and feel like it being worth the first Acme to be ported.
